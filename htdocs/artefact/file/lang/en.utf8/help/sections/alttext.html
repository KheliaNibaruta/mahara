<h1>Alt text</h1>
<p>This is the text used as the tooltip of the image.</p>
<p>This text is meant to describe what the image actually shows rather than what it portrays.</p>
<p>For example, the alt text for an image of a sparrow could be "Bird standing on tree branch" whereas the description, the image caption, could be "Sparrow singing at dawn".</p>
