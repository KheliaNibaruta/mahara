<h1>Export your portfolio</h1>
<p>You can export your portfolio to keep your files and content offline. You can create an export at any time and as
  often as you wish. When the export is finished, you will receive a ZIP file containing the following:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone HTML website:</strong> A website with your portfolio data that you can navigate. You cannot import
  this into Mahara or another portfolio system again, but it is readable in a standard web browser, and you do not need
  Mahara in order to view it. To view, extract the ZIP file and click on the index.html file that is in the HTML folder.
</p>
<p><strong>Leap2A:</strong> This can be imported into a Mahara instance again. Make sure to upload the entire ZIP
  directory and not only the Leap2A.xml file. Import is supported for such an export to be imported into the same or
  newer version of Mahara. If you are going to an older version of Mahara, your content may not always be fully
  displayed as some functionality might be missing.
