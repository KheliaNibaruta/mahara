<h1>SmartEvidence</h1>
<p>SmartEvidence allows your learners to work with a competency framework in
a portfolio. They will have an overview page containing a matrix where
they can see quickly, for which competencies they have already gathered evidence, 
which have been approved by an assessor or
themselves if the framework allows self-assessment, and where they
need more work.</p>
<p>
When activated, learners can turn a regular collection into a
SmartEvidence collection in order to use that portfolio with a
competency framework.</p>
