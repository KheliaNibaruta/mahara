<h1>Show submitted portfolios</h1>
<p>When you select this option, portfolios that you submitted for assessment
  are displayed. This includes portfolios that are currently under review that
  you can't edit and portfolios that have been released recently.</p>
<p>You can turn the latter into regular portfolios in the page or collection
  settings so you can edit them and continue working on them instead of the
  original portfolio.</p>
