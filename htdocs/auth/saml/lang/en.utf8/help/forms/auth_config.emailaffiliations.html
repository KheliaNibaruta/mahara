<h1>SAML 2.0 field for affiliation emails</h1>
<p>The Identity Provider (IdP) can pass in affiliation information for account holders. This field works in conjunction with</p>
    <ul>
      <li>SSO field for affiliation IDs</li>
      <li>SSO field for affiliation roles</li>
      <li>SSO field for affiliation role delimiter</li>
    </ul>

<p>If you set this value, the system will check which affiliation role is the highest and set the associated email to be the primary email address when the account holder logs in for the first time.</p>
<p>If you leave this blank then the value in 'SSO field for email' will be used instead.</p>
