<h1>People</h1>
<p>This page lets you search for people to add as contacts or simply to find
   their profile page. Depending on their contact control settings, you may
   be automatically accepted as their contact or you may need to send a
   contact request. Some people may not allow contact requests at all.</p>
<p>When sending a contact request, you can choose to include a short message
  introducing yourself. This is especially important if you have a display name
  set as others will not see your real name.</p>
  <p>You can also see a list of your current and pending contacts.</p>
  <p>A person can resubmit a contact request to you, even if you have previously rejected their request.</p>
