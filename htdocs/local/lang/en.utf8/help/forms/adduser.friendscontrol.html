<h1>Contact control</h1>
<p>Choose whether others may add this person to their contact list. If the person is added to a contact list, the owner of that list is added to the person's list as well. When the person removes someone from their contact list, the person is also removed from the other person's list. Choose either:</p>
<p><strong>Nobody may add you as a contact:</strong> no one may add this person to their contact list.</p>
<p><strong>New contacts require my authorisation:</strong> the person's authorisation is needed for them to be added to a contact list. If they approve, they will be added to a contact list.</p>
<p><strong>New contacts are automatically authorised:</strong> anyone may add the person to their list.</p>
