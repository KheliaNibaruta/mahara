<h1>Contact control</h1>
<p>Choose whether other people may add you to their contact list. If you are added to a contact list, the owner of that list is added to your list as well. When you remove someone from your contact list, you are also removed from their list. Choose either:</p>
<p><strong>Nobody may add me as a contact:</strong> no one may add you to their list.</p>
<p><strong>New contacts require my authorisation:</strong> your authorisation is needed for you to be added to a list. If you approve, they will be added to your list.</p>
<p><strong>New contacts are automatically authorised:</strong> anyone may add you to their list.</p>
