<h1>Contact control</h1>
<p>Choose whether others may add these people to their contact list. If they are added to a contact list, the owner of that list is added to their list as well. When people remove someone from their contact list, they are also removed from the other person's list. Choose one of the following as default option:</p>
<p><strong>Nobody may add me as a contact:</strong> no one may add these people to their list.</p>
<p><strong>New contacts require my authorisation:</strong> the person's authorisation is needed for them to be added to a list. If they approve, they will be added to another person's list.</p>
<p><strong>New contacts are automatically authorised:</strong> anyone may add these people to their list.</p>
